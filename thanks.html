    <blockquote cite="http://www.armchairnews.com/freelance/eggers.html">
      <p>&hellip;The thing is, I really like saying yes. I like new things,
      projects, plans, getting people together and doing something, trying
      something, even when it's corny or stupid. I am not good at saying no.
      And I do not get along with people who say no. When you die, and it
      really could be this afternoon, under the same bus wheels I'll stick my
      head if need be, you will not be happy about having said no. You will be
      kicking your ass about all the no's you've said. No to that opportunity,
      or no to that trip to Nova Scotia or no to that night out, or no to that
      project or no to that person who wants to be naked with you but you
      worry about what your friends will say.</p>

      <p><strong>No is for wimps.</strong> No is for pussies. No is to live
      small and embittered, cherishing the opportunities you missed because
      they might have sent the wrong message.</p>
    
      <p>There is a point in one's life when one cares about selling out
      and not selling out. One worries whether or not wearing a certain
      shirt means that they are behind the curve or ahead of it, or that
      having certain music in one's collection means that they are
      impressive, or unimpressive.</p>
    
      <p>Thankfully, for some, this all passes. I am here to tell you that
      I have, a few years ago, found my way out of that thicket of
      comparison and relentless suspicion and judgment. And it is a nice
      feeling. Because, in the end, no one will ever give a shit who has
      kept shit 'real' except the two or three people, sitting in their
      apartments, bitter and self-devouring, who take it upon themselves to
      wonder about such things. The keeping real of shit matters to some
      people, but it does not matter to me. It's fashion, and I don't like
      fashion, because fashion does not matter.</p>
    
      <p>What matters is that you do good work. What matters is that you
      produce things that are true and will stand. What matters is that the
      Flaming Lips's new album is ravishing and I've listened to it a
      thousand times already, sometimes for days on end, and it enriches me
      and makes me want to save people. What matters is that it will stand
      forever, long after any narrow-hearted curmudgeons have forgotten
      their appearance on goddamn 90210. What matters is not the perception,
      nor the fashion, not who's up and who's down, but what someone has
      done and if they meant it. What matters is that you want to see and
      make and do, on as grand a scale as you want, regardless of what the
      tiny voices of tiny people say. Do not be critics, you people, I beg
      you. I was a critic and I wish I could take it all back because it
      came from a smelly and ignorant place in me, and spoke with a voice
      that was all rage and envy. Do not dismiss a book until you have
      written one, and do not dismiss a movie until you have made one, and
      do not dismiss a person until you have met them. It is a fuckload of
      work to be open-minded and generous and understanding and forgiving
      and accepting, but Christ, that is what matters. What matters is
      saying yes.</p>
