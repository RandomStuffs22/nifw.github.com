    <blockquote cite="http://www.armchairnews.com/freelance/eggers.html">
      <p>...The thing is, I really like saying yes. I like new things,
      projects, plans, getting people together and doing something, trying
      something, even when it's corny or stupid. I am not good at saying no.
      And I do not get along with people who say no. When you die, and it
      really could be this afternoon, under the same bus wheels I'll stick my
      head if need be, you will not be happy about having said no. You will be
      kicking your ass about all the no's you've said. No to that opportunity,
      or no to that trip to Nova Scotia or no to that night out, or no to that
      project or no to that person who wants to be naked with you but you
      worry about what your friends will say.</p>

      <p><strong>No is for wimps.</strong> No is for pussies. No is to live
      small and embittered, cherishing the opportunities you missed because
      they might have sent the wrong message.</p>
    
      <p>There is a point in one's life when one cares about selling out
      and not selling out. One worries whether or not wearing a certain
      shirt means that they are behind the curve or ahead of it, or that
      having certain music in one's collection means that they are
      impressive, or unimpressive.</p>
    
      <p>Thankfully, for some, this all passes. I am here to tell you that
      I have, a few years ago, found my way out of that thicket of
      comparison and relentless suspicion and judgment. And it is a nice
      feeling. Because, in the end, no one will ever give a shit who has
      kept shit 'real' except the two or three people, sitting in their
      apartments, bitter and self-devouring, who take it upon themselves to
      wonder about such things. The keeping real of shit matters to some
      people, but it does not matter to me. It's fashion, and I don't like
      fashion, because fashion does not matter.</p>
    
      <p>What matters is that you do good work. What matters is that you
      produce things that are true and will stand. What matters is that the
      Flaming Lips's new album is ravishing and I've listened to it a
      thousand times already, sometimes for days on end, and it enriches me
      and makes me want to save people. What matters is that it will stand
      forever, long after any narrow-hearted curmudgeons have forgotten
      their appearance on goddamn 90210. What matters is not the perception,
      nor the fashion, not who's up and who's down, but what someone has
      done and if they meant it. What matters is that you want to see and
      make and do, on as grand a scale as you want, regardless of what the
      tiny voices of tiny people say. Do not be critics, you people, I beg
      you. I was a critic and I wish I could take it all back because it
      came from a smelly and ignorant place in me, and spoke with a voice
      that was all rage and envy. Do not dismiss a book until you have
      written one, and do not dismiss a movie until you have made one, and
      do not dismiss a person until you have met them. It is a fuckload of
      work to be open-minded and generous and understanding and forgiving
      and accepting, but Christ, that is what matters. What matters is
      saying yes.</p>

        <h2>Introducing Creative Summer Camp</h2>
          <p>NIFW Creative Summer Camp is a 6-week interactive online course for people who want to work on a creative project but are lacking the motivation, structure or courage to get started.</p>

          <p>Creative Summer Camp is designed to <strong>pull the best out of your creative self</strong>. It might be a good fit for you if:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>You aren't always creatively fulfilled in your day job and you want an outlet</li>
            <li>You have a project in mind but haven't been able to get it off the ground</li>
            <li>You have a little time and motivation to do something different this summer</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>CSC is designed for you to scratch your creative itch. This isn't
        about telling you what you should be doing, but rather helping you
        accomplish some of the stuff you've been thinking about.</p>
        
        <p>First you'll identify a project you'd like to spend some time and
        energy on this summer. (Need ideas? Scroll down!) From June 4 to July
        13, 2012, you'll be one of six students who work individually, in a
        group and with Jen as a mentor. Students may all have vastly different
        projects, but you'll find there are many similarities in making space
        for the creative process and projects. You'll interact with the group
        to the degree you're interested, gather inspiration and hopefully some
        ideas for making space for your project.</p>
        
        <p>You'll also have ongoing access to Jen for support, motivation and
        gentle guidance, including three Skype chats with her along the way.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p>This is the first course, so we're thinking about it as an
        experiment. It's free to the first six adventure-seekers who register!
        We'll ask for your feedback along the way so we can understand the
        strengths and weaknesses of the format.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What counts as a creative project?</h2>
        <p>Anything, really, but here's a brain dump. You may want to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Write a short story</li>
          <li>Develop 1 or more recipes</li>
          <li>Learn to draw</li>
          <li>Start a blog</li>
          <li>Take more photos</li>
          <li>Write a song on the guitar</li>
          <li>Write a chapter of your thesis</li>
          <li>Code an iPhone app</li>
          <li>Prepare for an open-mic night</li>
          <li>Submit an essay to a magazine for publication</li>
          <li>Paint a portrait</li>
          <li>Start an Etsy store</li>
          <li>Plan and prepare for a big trip</li>
          <li>Write a one-act play</li>
          <li>… pretty much anything else that has a mini-goal and feels creative to you!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is No Is For Wimps?</h2>
        <figure><img src="images/jen-headshot.jpg" alt="Photo of Jen" width="200" height="320"></figure>

        <p>Inspired by Dave Egger's 2000 interview in the Harvard Advocate,
        NIFW is a site dedicated to the pursuit of creative endeavors. Lots of
        us grow up with creative talents that, for one reason or another,
        don't make it into our day jobs. NIFW is a site designed to nurture
        the creativity back into our adult lives - to make a little time and
        space for a creative hobby.</p>
        
        <p>In 2007, NIFW was an online literary magazine that supported
        artists, singers, writers and other creative folk through its
        bi-weekly publication. Online courses are the next incarnation of the
        brand and we're excited to share it with the world!</p>
        
        <p>NIFW is established and led by Jen Dary, a user-experience
        designer with a writing background… and self-proclaimed
        project-a-holic. She acutely understands the difficulties in finding
        time and energy to fit creative projects into daily life and is
        excited to support others in their own creative quests.</p>
        
        <p>Jen will lead Creative Summer Camp, the first NIFW course,
        beginning in June 2012.</p>
