        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>No is for wimps. No is for pussies. No is to live
            small and embittered, cherishing the opportunities you missed because
            they might have sent the wrong message.</strong></p>
        
            <p>There is a point in one's life when one cares about selling out
            and not selling out. One worries whether or not wearing a certain
            shirt means that they are behind the curve or ahead of it, or that
            having certain music in one's collection means that they are
            impressive, or unimpressive.</p>
        
            <p>Thankfully, for some, this all passes. I am here to tell you that
            I have, a few years ago, found my way out of that thicket of
            comparison and relentless suspicion and judgment. And it is a nice
            feeling. Because, in the end, no one will ever give a shit who has
            kept shit 'real' except the two or three people, sitting in their
            apartments, bitter and self-devouring, who take it upon themselves to
            wonder about such things. The keeping real of shit matters to some
            people, but it does not matter to me. It's fashion, and I don't like
            fashion, because fashion does not matter.</p>
        
            <p>What matters is that you do good work. What matters is that you
            produce things that are true and will stand. What matters is that the
            Flaming Lips's new album is ravishing and I've listened to it a
            thousand times already, sometimes for days on end, and it enriches me
            and makes me want to save people. What matters is that it will stand
            forever, long after any narrow-hearted curmudgeons have forgotten
            their appearance on goddamn 90210. What matters is not the perception,
            nor the fashion, not who's up and who's down, but what someone has
            done and if they meant it. What matters is that you want to see and
            make and do, on as grand a scale as you want, regardless of what the
            tiny voices of tiny people say. Do not be critics, you people, I beg
            you. I was a critic and I wish I could take it all back because it
            came from a smelly and ignorant place in me, and spoke with a voice
            that was all rage and envy. Do not dismiss a book until you have
            written one, and do not dismiss a movie until you have made one, and
            do not dismiss a person until you have met them. It is a fuckload of
            work to be open-minded and generous and understanding and forgiving
            and accepting, but Christ, that is what matters. What matters is
            saying yes.</p>
        
            <p>I say yes, and Wayne Coyne says yes, and if that makes us the
            enemy, then good, good, good. We are evil people because we want to
            live and do things. We are on the wrong side because we should be
            home, calculating which move would be the least damaging to our
            downtown reputations. But I say yes because I am curious. I want to
            see things. I say yes when my high school friend tells me to come out
            because he's hanging with Puffy. A real story, that. I say yes when
            Hollywood says they'll give me enough money to publish a hundred
            different books, or send twenty kids through college. Saying no is so
            fucking boring.</p>
        
            <p>And if anyone wants to hurt me for that, or dismiss me for that,
            for saying yes, I say Oh do it, do it you motherfuckers, finally,
            finally, finally.</p>
